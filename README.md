## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom checkbox, gradient background, gradient border
- Vanilla Js

### What I learned

- Enchanced my Javascript skills.
- Practised DOM manipulation for common actions like adding, deleting, and modifying elements, using vanilla Js and not a framework.
- Implemented dark/light mode.
- Created a custom checkbox with gradient background and border.

### Continued development

**Drag and drop**: Implementation of drag and drop using pure javascript and not a library.

**Browser support**: I tried to tackle the gradient borders using pseudo-elements however it didnt work as expected. For that reason I used [masks](https://caniuse.com/css-masks), which lack full support.

### Useful resources

- [Custom checkbox](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/) - This is a very helpful article about creating custom checkboxes.
- [Gradient borders](https://nikitahl.com/gradient-border-css) - This article provides different ways to implement gradient borders.
